       <p><i><font color="red"><font face="Bahnschrift Condensed">Your passwords in website for example facebook is saved in MD5 Hash format like for example if you keep your password as 123 then your MD5 hash would be 202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70 and it would be much easier to crack small passwords that's why you are recommended to keep your password unique and big so that the hash generated is not common and it should be hard for the hacker to crack the hash. As if you try to enter your hash in the password area then it would identify it as incorrect so hackers need to crack the hash to get access.</font></font></i></p></center>
       <h2><font face="Bahnschrift Condensed"><b>There are 3 types of password attacks-</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dictionary Attack- When a hacker attempts to get the password by many sets of word until he finds the correct set of words as password.</li>
            <li>Brute force attack- In which hacker submits many password until he founds one of them as correct.</li>
            <li>Keyloggers- In which hacker has control to your keyboard and can monitor the activity when you are using your keyboard to logging in to your account.</li>
