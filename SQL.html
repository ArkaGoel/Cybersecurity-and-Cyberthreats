        <p>It  is basically retrieving hidden data which like passwords from the database. By the Structured Oriented Language. </p>
        <p>It Occurs when an uninted data enters a program from untrusted source.</p>
        <h3>The main consquences for this are-</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Confidentiality(Secret) - Since SQL database hold very sensitive data , loss of Confidentiality is a frequent problem.</li>
            <li>Authentication(Recognizing a user's identify)- is poor SQL commands are used to check user names and passwords, then it may be be easy to enter to someone else's account without knowing password.</li>
            <li>Rights- Can change the information and rights.</li>
