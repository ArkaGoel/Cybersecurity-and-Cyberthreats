    <p>There are 2 general methods of DOS attack which are : Flood attacks crashing services. Flood attacks occur when the system receives too much traffic for the server to buffer, causing them to slow down and eventually stop</p>
        <h2>The 3 Popular types of flood attacks are-</h2>
 <ul>
     <li>Buffer overflow attacks - the most common DOS attack. The concept is to send  more traffic to a network address than the programmers have built the system to handle.</li>
     <li>ICMP flood - An Internal Control Message Protocol flood DDoS attack also known as ping flood attack which sends many echo requests to a targeted device.</li>
     <li>SYN flood â€“ where attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection. The server has to spend resources on waiting for half opened connections which consume a lot of traffic and makes the system unresponsive.</li>
 </ul>
